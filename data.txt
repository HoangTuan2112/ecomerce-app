Panerai watches not only stand as a silent witness to the passage of time but as examples of the indelible mark the Italian manufacturer continues to leave on the watchmaking industry.

This Panerai Luminor Base Logo watch reference PAM01087 is yet another example of the brand’s expert workmanship. The model is crafted from stainless steel and features a white dial with silver accented, luminous coated Arabic numerals at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock.
